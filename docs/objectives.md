## Measuring Success

UDDF will be considered successful when:

1. **Technical systems** work reliably at scale
2. **Operational metrics** meet or exceed targets
3. **Strategic adoption** by government is achieved
4. **Public impact** is measurably positive

All four dimensions must succeed for UDDF to achieve its transformative potential.
